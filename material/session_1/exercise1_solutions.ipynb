With unbalanced data accuracy has the undesired property of being high under a decision rule that always assigns the majority class. Consider e.g. a dataset with 100 observations, of which 5 are \"good fish\" and 95 \"bad fish\"; always predicting \"bad fish\" results in a 95% accuracy. Note that this is not the unique way to get 95% accuracy, we could also imagine a model that correctly identifies all 5 good fish, but mislabels 5 bad fish. To solve this problem we want a model-performance-metric that is not blind to class imbalance.\n",
